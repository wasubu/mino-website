Hi thanks for reading

This is my next big project. yep, it's building a documentation site for Retrogadgets.

Why?
Well, it's not like the current official one sucks but when I look at other documentations not specific RG, I always wonder I it's possible to make an interactive one. 

to make this work, conventional libraries won't cut it so I have to build the doc site from scratch with the help of Vite, React and tailwind.
